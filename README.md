# Yakima Wine Tasters Landing Page

To offer an example of what I've learned as far as HTML and CSS I made up a club
based in my home town of Yakima where we are well known for our local Wineries.
This landing page does contain links to the Yakima Valley's pages for finding
the best Wineries and for keeping up with upcoming events.

In the next few days I will update my CSS file to allow for mobile viewing. With 
HTML I will add a form the allows individuals to input information to join the 
clubs news letter. 

This is not a real club. Any information added to the form will not be saved.
